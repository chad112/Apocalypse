    <h1 class="page-title"> About </h1><hr>
    <p class="about-text"><span>Driven by the most humble of urges, the desire to escape the heavy authority and expectations of our modern world, beer lovers Doug John and his wife Lee started Apocalypse Ale Works conceptually over a decade ago. The doors officially opened February, 2013.</span><span>Back then it was just a tiny flame of an idea built by a passion for delicious beer and a rebellion to the accepted norm that beer was a watered down, tastless drink that couldn't also be enjoyed while indulging.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">

<span>It started as a home brewing setup and a circle of friends, and grew to a home brew supply shop, picking up medals along the way until the passion for beer grew to great to be contained in an idea.</span><span>Jumping on an opportunity the Johns made the choice to leave the world they once knew behind them, and to put all of their energy into a new idea of their own creation, Apocalypse Ale Works.</span><span> With all this said, there are no investors in Apocalypse Ale Works, so that there was no pressure to sacrifice any quality for the sake of the business.</span><span> Doug and Lee are committed to using only the finest ingredients, and giving even up to six weeks time to make a beer.</span><span>It isn't about the volume of beer made, it's all about the highest quality brew, and reputation that a small, family owned brewery can have. </span>

<p class="about-text text-center subtitle">Our seal says it all, from our philosophy to the story of how we got here...</p>
<p class="about-text"><span>The giant A on top represents the "Alpha," to us the new beginning of better world, resting on top of the darkness we left behind.</span><span>The darkness is symbolized in the "Omega" depicted in our logo three times in the shape of the horns in order to denote the three chains we had to break to proceed.</span><span>Letting go of a bad job, a bad boss, and a bad life all at once! </span></p>
<p class="about-text"><span>The pyramid represents that by following spiritual and physical guiding lights we could build a foundation and reach the pinnacle of success for US and not for corporate USA.</span><span>Our physical guiding lights are our family.</span><span>Lee, born X IV, our daughter Ashlyn born IX IV, and our son Austin born XII XII.</span><span>The pyramid is placed on top of the darkness and earthy worries which were left behind to burn and fuel our new beginning!</span><span>Also in our artwork we like to represent our guiding lights with the Orion's Belt constellation, a trinity that has served with some significance throughout all of man.</span></p>
<p class="about-text"><span>The number 72 is also represented in the logo. Da Vinci had this in the Mona Lisa.</span><span>Some denoted this was a number for perfection.</span><span>For us it is a number for perfection and that's why we have 72 barley corns on each side of the logo.</span><span>It is also important because my '72 Miami dolphins were and still are the only team in the nfl to be perfect 17-0!</span></p>
<p class="about-text">As every end brings a new beginning, we've chosen the ultimate ending through Apocalypse Ale Works, to raise with it a newer, brighter future.  </p>
