The 6th Seal Imperial Stout is the 6th Seal Chocolate Stout on Steroids! This beer has ample quantities of roasted barley and double the hops. It has a more aggresive flavor profile and is deceptively strong. This is a beer that the Czars would fight over. ABV: 9.2% IBUs: 45        </div>

  This Scottish Style "Wee Heavy" exhibits three words: BIG, SMOOTH AND MALTY! This ale is deep copper in color with ruby highlights and a creamy head. While you will not pick up any noticeable hop flavor or aroma your tongue will be thrilled with malty sweetness and a hint of smokiness. We take pride in brewing this by classic Scottish brewing techniques that include kettle caramelization and fermentation at 50F degrees for 4 weeks. To be enjoyed with smoked meat, salmon,
  gouda and swiss with or without a kilt!

  Aroma explodes with citrus hops and does not stop!  Hops in the beginning, middle and end.  Hopped as much as a double IPA but perfectly balanced with Munich malt to give both hopheads and malt lovers the best of both worlds.  Say no to the
  bland beer of the past and welcome the future of flavor!
